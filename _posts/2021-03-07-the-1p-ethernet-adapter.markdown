Yes, you read that correctly. A USB to ethernet adapter that costs a penny shipped and out of curiosity, I did buy one.
So, over the next few weeks, as this gets shipped from China to the UK, I'll keep this blog post updated with what's going on with this item.

After ordering, AliExpress sent the email over to comfirm the order and item specifics page is well, a bit confusing.

So, what is this? <br>

According to the product details, it has 802.11n 2.4GHz wireless and a transmission rate of 10Mbps while having a transmission speed of 600Mbps? <br>

Looking up the model number on the internet reveals other similar listings on both AliExpress and eBay and both have conflicting information.

The second AliExpess listing says that itâ€™s a 100mbps adapter but also that itâ€™s 802.11a/g and 802.11n while also being wired.

The one listed on eBay showed the same information as the one Iâ€™ve bought.

I've also checked the manufacturer's website and it's no longer listed so I  don't know what I've bought. ðŸ˜…

I've checked my card's transaction history and yes AliExpress only charged 1p, we'll see if it turns up in 30 - 50 days.
