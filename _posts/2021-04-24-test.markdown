This post was written on 2021-04-20 and I have put the date of this post as 2021-04-24, if you can read it before then on this site then scheduled posts either don't work or don't exist in Jekyll/GitHub Pages.

If this does go live on the 24th and not before (I will update it to confirm it) then scheduled posts do exist and work.

**UPDATE: It went live a bit after posting it and not on the 24th**
