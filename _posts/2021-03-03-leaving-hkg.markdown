After a long consideration during my break, I have decided that I no longer wish to continue my role as a member of this group. My reasoning to do so stems from what I have already explained in my statement about temporarily stepping back from my administrative roles, now I believe it’s time to make that permanent. 
My reasoning for leaving is simple, I believe that the “golden era” of this group has passed and that the feeling of the community has gone. Sure, the people are still here but the sense of community has gone.

After the transition period, I will still be available to contact over WhatsApp, Line and Signal though will no longer be part of the group.
I wish you all well going forward.
Hoi Kay
